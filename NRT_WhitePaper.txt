Not Real Obituary Token requires Proof-of-Death, to be more specific, the death of one's virtual avatar (social media accounts, unrevivable game characters and etc.)
We have enterred the cyber era. One's cyber avatar holds an essential piece of one's integrate identity. 
Unfortunately, that part of one's identity resides in rooms of servers possessed by the capital. With a few clicks, they and the powerful have the ability to murder, or even worse, erase the existence of, that part of one's identity.
With all regrets, we do not possess the power to counter theirs for now. But Not Real Obituary provides a corner in the cyber world, in which one can leave a trace, a rememberance of that part of one's identity.
Those who committed suicide to their virtual avatars are also warmly welcomed.
One can earn a token by submitting a valid obituary for thier virtual avatars at the Not Real Obituary project.
By earning the token through Proof-of-Death, the token itself serves as Proof-of-Existence.
